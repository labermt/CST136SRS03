Stone Template Pirates

Student Name: Andrew Deraita

Pokemon ID: Volbeat 

Issues: 

Interfaceing with the template may have been made simplified by storing
the country as a data member and doing the conversions one step at a time.

Notes: 

Program throws an exception if more than 99 cents are entered into the 
`double_alias` template.

Program throws an exception if the user tries to enter a country without
a weight into the `conversion` template.

Help for this assignment was obtained from
An Colkar. Specifically assistance with inception 
calling and the switch statment for country 
weights. Her code can be found
