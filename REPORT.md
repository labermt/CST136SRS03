Stone Template Pirates

Student Name: Jared Muralt

Issues: 
Couldn't figure out how to make the template paramters accept other data types besides int. 
I experimented with nesting conversions but couldn't figure it out.
This solution converted currency correctly so I am sticking with it.
Overall, I am struggling to figure out how templates work despite hours of studying.

Notes:
Currency input values are only integers and output is floating point.
