# CST136SRS03

Stone Template Pirates

Student Name: Anil Coklar

Issues:
None noted with the test cases sampled in main.cpp. The code appears to be working as intended and as requested in specs. 

Notes:
I worked with professor Besser for this assignment. Afterwards, I reviewed each header file afterwards to ensure competency. 
For currency, I took the  dollar and cent value as is, I did not convert the currency to a base currency. 

This code throws 2 exceptions:
1. If the country is not declared in the enum. 
2. If cent value is less than zero or over 99, or if the dollar amount entered is less than 0. To better optimize this code, I could have accepted negative dollar amounts. 

All values entered as dollars or cents, meaning it will not assume other currencies such as lira's, euros, etc. 
This code has a lot of comments to help me remember what I did and why I did it, especially during presentation. 
For this assignment, I worked with Colin R. and Drew D., Mike W., and Sasha S., but mostly with professor Besser.
