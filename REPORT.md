Stone Template Pirates

Student Name: Timothy Carpenter

Issues: //no code

Notes: //ToDo: write code


Purpose:

- Learn to use templates.
- Understand the difference between compile-time and run-time code. 

To figure this out, you need to write templates to convert the value of local currency to other currencies. 
You need to write templates to convert between currencies. Your goal is to generate **NO** code. 
Ideally this means everything is calculated by the compiler.  

Here is a conversion table you can use for your software:  
| Country          | Code | Value |
| ---------------- | ---- | ----- |
| United States    | US   | 1.00  |
| Australia        | AU   | 0.76  |
| New Zealand      | NZ   | 0.71  |
| Fiji             | FJ   | 0.49  |
| Tonga            | TO   | 0.45  | 
| Papua New Guinea | PG   | 0.31  |
| Solomon Islands  | SB   | 0.13  |
