Issues: There are of course rounding issues because the program uses integers and division. This means the conversions are often not exact, though very close. 

Notes: The program converts any of the listed currencies to any of the other listed currencies. It takes the original currency, converts it to the chosen US base currency, and then converts that to the desired currency. The program does not accept fractional values, only integers. The program deals with cents, not dollars. So 1.35 would be entered as 135.
